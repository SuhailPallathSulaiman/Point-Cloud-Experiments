# This program uses the Iterative Closest Point algorithm in order to incrementally register a series of point clouds two by two.

The idea is to transform all the clouds in the first cloudâ€™s frame.
This is done by finding the best transform between each consecutive cloud, and accumulating these transforms over the whole set of clouds.
